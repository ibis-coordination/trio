# Trio Model Definitions
#
# base_model_list: Backend models (same format as litellm-config.yaml)
# trio_model_list: Trio ensemble models, referenced with "trio:<model_name>"
#
# NOTE: All ensemble members run in PARALLEL. Each model only sees
# the original messages, not each other's responses. Aggregation
# (voting/synthesis) happens after all responses are collected.
